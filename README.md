## Welcome to CMPT 221L: Software Development 2!

In this repository, you will find all of your assignments for the semester. We will be leveraging git to submit and review assignments. This will help us stay organized and expose you to some real-life best practices.

In this README, I've provided everything you need to get yourself set up for the semester, along with some helpful reminders.

### Step 1: Download VSCode

First things first, you need a code editor to actually complete these labs. I strongly recommend using VSCode, as that's what I'll be using for demonstrations throughout the semester, but you can use whatever best suits you.
I like VSCode because it has a bunch of helpful features and (optional) plugins which will make navigating this course a breeze.
